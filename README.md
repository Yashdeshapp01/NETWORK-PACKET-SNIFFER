ABOUT THE TOOL
A network packet sniffer, also known as a packet analyser, is a tool used to intercept and analyse data packets that are sent over a network. It is typically used by network administrators and security professionals to monitor and troubleshoot network traffic. 
Packet sniffers work by intercepting and capturing packets of data as they are transmitted over a network. Once a packet is captured, the sniffer can analyse the data within it, including the source and destination IP addresses, the protocols being used, and the contents of the packet itself. This information can be used to diagnose network problems, monitor network traffic, and detect security threats. 
It's important to note that the use of packet sniffers can be a sensitive issue, as they can potentially be used to capture sensitive information. Therefore, their use should be carefully considered and only used for legitimate purposes.
What we try to implement:
We try to make a simpler version of Packet Sniffer which is able to tell 
•	the Protocol, 
•	Time to Live and 
•	the Source and Destination Ip of the packet on the network which follows the IPv4, TCP and UDP protocol.
These were the things in our scope
The sniffing of Packets following the IPv6 Protocol were the beyond the scope of this Project
But surely can be done in the future scope
Our Learnings and Conclusion:
We learnt how socket programming and unpacking of struct in python along with the knowledge of various datagrams in computer Networks helps us in developing a basic packet sniffing tool.
